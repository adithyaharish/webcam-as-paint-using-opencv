# webcam-as-paint-using-opencv
using opencv, we take real time webcam and use the movements to form a paint like application.

Given the real time webcam data, this paint-like python application uses OpenCV library to track an object-of-interest (a bottle cap in this case) and allows the user to draw by moving the object, which makes it both awesome and challenging to draw simple things.

#CODE REQUIREMENTS:
1.  python version 3.6 or more is better
2. you also need to install opencv library
